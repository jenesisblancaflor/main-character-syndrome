	<h3 class = "preStatement"> What are some telling signs of Main Character Syndrome?</h3>
	<p> Main chacacter syndrome is on the rise throughout the country and affects many people on social media, specifically, millenials and Gen-Z. Here are some ways to know if you or a loved one may be suffering from main character syndrome.</p>
	<div class = "causes">
	<div class = "causeItem">
		<img src= "images/onPhone.jpg" class = "causeImg">
		<h2 class = "cause" > Need for Community </h2>
		<p class = "causeInfo"> Often times MCS can be causes by a lack of community. As they desperately seek the spotlight, their real-life struggles transform into theatrical performances for imaginary audiences. This stark lack of community robs them of the precious perspectives that come from shared experiences. The prescription for recovery lies in rebuilding authentic relationships and rediscovering the value of human connection.  </p>
	</div>

	<div class = "causeItem">
		<img src= "images/money.jpg" class = "causeImg">
		<h2 class = "cause" > Need for Money </h2>
		<p class = "causeInfo">Main character syndrome can often times be caused for the need/drive of money. People see the marketability of social media and main character syndrome begins to devlop as they try to make brands and audiences see them. Once they get a taste of that green stuff (aka money) they are hooked and will do anything to make that moola from brands or selling things to their audiences. A simple want to make a few dollars cna turn into a money hungry beast with MCS.</p>
	</div>

	<div class = "causeItem">
		<img src= "images/manDancing.jpg" class = "causeImg">
		<h2 class = "cause" > Need for Ego Inflation</h2>
		<p class = "causeInfo">This variant finds patients relentlessly inflating their egos, making them the hot air balloons of the social sphere. They want people to shower  them with praise and bathe in the glow of their imagined perfection. They create idealistic personas in hopes people will envy them and say praise. Often times this is fabricated and everything is not like is seems. The pursuit of perfection cannot mask the main character syndrome.</p>
	</div>

	<div class = "causeItem">
		<img src= "images/posing.jpg" class = "causeImg">
		<h2 class = "cause" > Need for Fame</h2>
		<p class = "causeInfo">Enter the glamorous world of the "Need for Fame" MCS category, where individuals cast themselves as the stars of their own reality shows. Mundane tasks like grocery shopping and morning routines become dazzling red carpet events. They live their lives in a state of constant performance, hoping to attract an adoring fanbase. Every day is a potential plot twist, and they eagerly await the applause of an imaginary studio audience.</p>
	</div>

	<div class = "causeItem">
		<img src= "images/ringLight.jpg"class = "causeImg">
		<h2 class = "cause" > Need for Influence</h2>
		<p class = "causeInfo">Sufferers of this MCS subtype perceive their opinions as divine revelations. Their self-worth hinges on the number of social media disciples they obtain. They want every post, from profound reflections to snapshots of avocado toast, carries the weight of the word of god. Their quest for validation turns them into the self-proclaimed influencers of the digital realm, convinced that they're slaying the internet.</p>
	</div>
	<div class = "causeItem">
		<img src= "images/gymBro.jpg"class = "causeImg">
		<h2 class = "cause" > Need for Power</h2>
		<p class = "causeInfo"> Another cause for MCS is when individuals believe they can control others on the internet.  They see themselves as puppet masters, with life's strings firmly in their grip. Manipulating situations, they orchestrate elaborate power plays in their minds. They want to control the online space and not just influence, but control the people that follow them. This cause often stems from the "influencer" cause as more of an exterme version.</p>
