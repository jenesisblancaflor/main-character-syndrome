	<h2> History of main character syndrome.</h2>
	<div class="history">

		<div>
			<h3 class="preStatement">Patient 0: Josh Harris</h3>
			<p class="historyBlurb">The earliest case of main character syndrome can be traced back to the 1990s and Josh Harris. Picture Harris, clad in the finest late-90s tech-entrepreneur garb (think turtlenecks and ill-fitting blazers), preaching the gospel of constant online presence. He did anything and everything for attention and it worked, people watched him and followed him. Conversely, it came at the expense of his relationships with his family and his partner. He no longer cared about those around him, he only cared about the fame and success he was garnering online.</p>

	<h2> An Analysis of Main Character Syndrome as Types</h2>

	<div class="type2">
		<div class="typeDiv">
			<h3 class="types">Type 1: Fitting In</h3>
			<p class="typeInfo">The first type of main character syndrome is fitting in. These people are looking for a community online to like them or seeking virality. They haven't yet reached this level of fame and live somewhat normal lives. In the photo we can see someone say, "The NYC outfit videos are just more authentic featuring New Yorkers." This implies she sees those around her like props and accessories to her content. She is beginning to show symptoms of main character syndrome. These people will post anything as long as they think it will make others engage.</p>

			<h3 class="types">TYPE 2: Money Hungry</h3>
			<p class="typeInfo">The second type of main character syndrome is those that are persuaded by money. They will do anything and everything to make money, particularly at the expense of themselves or others around them. This can be seen in the TikTok NPC live streams. In these lives, we see people following viewers' commands based on the items they are gifted. The viewers control the streamer, and the streamer believes in their self-importance.</p>

	<div class="type2">
		<div class="typeDiv">
			<h3 class="types">TYPE 3: The Influencer</h3>
			<p class="typeInfo">The third type of main character syndrome is the influencer. This person has already reached internet fame and is quickly losing touch with reality. They see every aspect of life as a chance for content and have completely disassociated with the real world. In the photo, we see the influencer affected by main character syndrome who says, "Just finished working, it’s 5:19. Try being an influencer for a day. Try it... Every single day I get up at 6 A.M." She truly believes, in the best of heart, that being an influencer is one of the most difficult jobs in the world. She is too far gone.</p>

			<h3 class="types">TYPE 4: Pursuit of Control</h3>
			<p class="typeInfo">The fourth type of main character syndrome is someone who is in pursuit of control. This main character knows they already have influence over a large group and personifies a fake persona to maintain that control. They will do or say anything to keep their fame, even if it means people hate them or they’re spreading harmful ideology. Their audience is loyal, easily influenced, and buys whatever they're selling. This fuels their ego and makes them a LOT of money. Typically, they're bald and ugly so I don't see the appeal.</p>

		<div class="typeDiv">
			<h3 class="types">TYPE 5: World Domination</h3>
			<p class="typeInfo">The fifth type of main character syndrome is world domination. This person is so far gone from reality that they are literally on Mars. They say whatever they want because they know there will be no repercussions. They enjoy watching people react to their wild statements and thrive in the chaos their words create. They are detached from the world, ruling from their mansions with glee.</p>
